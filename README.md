# SecureCoin-Sentinel
ðŸ›¡ SecureCoin Sentinel is an AI-powered platform that simplifies scam detection with the click of a button. The SecureCoin Sentinel model consists of a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a variation of Microsoft's CodeBERT model. This was part of a Hackathon at CSU - Sacramento. 

ðŸ§ The FNN was trained on Tokenomics Data, the RNN on transaction history, and the codeBERT model on smart contracts of rug-pulled versus non-rug-pulled coins. All of these models fed into a final fusion layer to accurately predict, from 0-1, whether a cryptocurrency was legit or a scam.

ðŸ–¥ Finally, with all our data, trained models, and live data fed into the front end, we had a working product! The SecureCoin Sentinel makes sure your wallet stays secure from scam tokens. All the user has to do is input the ticker symbol and our product handles the rest.
